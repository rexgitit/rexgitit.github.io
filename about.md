15 years as a designer.
He has experience in designing web, apps, and kiosks, mainly developing UI launcher design for Android-type products, and also has experience in planning proposal documents, designing and developing government content proposals, and winning proposal projects.

The video production was also unnecessary. The project was carried out as a PD and PM of a video that presents the video suggested by the PR center and the company and the vision of the future, and also designed the GUI concept of the video business.

It is difficult to say that there is any depth in web, app, video, and publishing design work, but I think I have experienced all the 2d design work.

They properly organize screen planning and storyboards, and have experience in documentation and wireframes. Although products such as services or images were produced, there seems to be many things that commercialization was not a stake.

The ability to grasp and proceed with the business process seems to be adequate. So, I had a lot of trouble because I was in charge of a business that usually didn't work well.

I have a lot of experience, but I haven't been able to find an interesting job.
